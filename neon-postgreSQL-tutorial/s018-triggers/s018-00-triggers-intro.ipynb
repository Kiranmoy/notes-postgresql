    "Triggers are useful in case the database is accessed by various applications, and you want to keep the cross-functionality within the database that runs automatically whenever the data of the table is modified. For example, if you want to keep the history of data without requiring the application to have logic to check for every event, such as `INSERT` or `UPDATE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can use triggers to maintain complex data integrity rules that cannot be implemented elsewhere except at the database level. For example, when a new row is added to the customer table, other rows must also be created in the tables of banks and credits.\n",
