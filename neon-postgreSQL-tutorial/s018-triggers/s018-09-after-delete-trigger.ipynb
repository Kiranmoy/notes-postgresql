    "In PostgreSQL, a trigger is a database object that is automatically activated in response to an event, including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` occurring on a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `AFTER DELETE` trigger is activated after one or more rows are deleted from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `AFTER DELETE` trigger can be particularly useful in some scenarios, such as logging deleted data, updating data in related tables, or enforcing complex business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an `AFTER DELETE` trigger, the `OLD` variable, which holds the value of the row being deleted, is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "To access a column value of the deleted row, you can use the syntax `OLD.column_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you cannot change the column values (`OLD.column_name`) because they are read-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an `AFTER DELETE` trigger, you follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, define a trigger function that will execute after a `DELETE` operation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```postgresql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trigger_function_name()\n",
    "RETURNS TRIGGER AS\n",
    "$$\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- This logic will be executed after the DELETE operation\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- To access the values of a column of the deleted row:\n",
    "    -- OLD.column_name\n",
    "\n",
    "    RETURN OLD;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "LANGUAGE plpgsql; \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second, create a trigger and associate the trigger function with it:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```postgresql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name\n",
    "AFTER DELETE ON table_name\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",

    "We’ll use an `AFTER DELETE` trigger to archive a deleted row in a separate table.\n",
