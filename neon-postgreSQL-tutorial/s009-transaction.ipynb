    "A **database transaction** is a single unit of work that consists of one or more operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of a transaction is a bank transfer from one account to another. A complete transaction must ensure a balance between the sender and receiver accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that if the sender account transfers X amount, the receiver receives exactly X amount, neither more nor less.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PostgreSQL transaction is atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. These properties are often referred to collectively as **ACID**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Atomicity** guarantees that the transaction is completed in an all-or-nothing manner.\n",
    "* **Consistency** ensures that changes to data written to the database are valid and adhere to predefined rules.\n",
    "* **Isolation** determines how the integrity of a transaction is visible to other transactions.\n",
    "* **Durability** ensures that transactions that have been committed are permanently stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you’ll use transactions in **stored procedures** in PostgreSQL and in the application code."
