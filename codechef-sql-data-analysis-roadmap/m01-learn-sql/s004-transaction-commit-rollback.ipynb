    "* A group of related operations that must succeed or fail together, to maintain consistency in a database.\n",
    "* A transaction is like a package of database operations that belong together. Think of it as a to-do list where either everything gets done, or nothing does.\n",
    "* For example, when you buy something online, the transaction might include: checking your balance, deducting money from your account, and updating the store's inventory. These steps must all succeed together for the purchase to be valid.\n",

    "**What is a Commit?**\n",
    "* A commit is like pressing the \"Save\" button on your changes.\n",
    "* When you commit a transaction, you're telling the database, \"I'm sure about all these changes - make them permanent\".\n",
    "* It's similar to signing a contract - once you commit, the changes are officially recorded and can't be easily undone.\n",

    "**What is a Rollback?**\n",
    "* A rollback is like an \"undo\" button for your transaction.\n",
    "* If anything goes wrong during your transaction (like a network error or insufficient funds), a rollback returns everything to how it was before the transaction started.\n",
    "* It's similar to erasing everything you wrote on a page and starting fresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Savepoint?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A SAVEPOINT is like placing multiple bookmarks while writing an important document.\n",
    "* If you make a mistake, instead of erasing everything and starting over, you can go back to the last bookmark and continue from there.\n",
    "* It allows partial rollback to a savepoint within the transaction instead of rolling back everything.\n",
    "* A SAVEPOINT creates a checkpoint in a transaction, allowing rollback to that specific point instead of discarding all changes.\n",

    "ACID properties are like a set of promises your database makes to keep your data safe and reliable, even when things go wrong. Think of them as safety rules that ensure your data stays accurate and consistent, just like safety protocols in a bank ensure your money is handled correctly.\n",

    "**What does ACID stand for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A - Atomicity**:\n",
    "    * All or nothing - like a pass code where every digit must be correct. Either the entire operation completes successfully, or none of it does.\n",
    "    * Atomicity ensures that either all parts of a transaction succeed or none do.\n",
    "    * If the system crashes or an error occurs before all operations are completed & committed, it will roll back the entire transaction **fully** (all operations) or **partially** (to a specific `SAVEPOINT`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **C - Consistency**:\n",
    "    * Your data should always follow the rules.\n",
    "    * Consistency ensures that data always follows business rules and constraints.\n",
    "    * For example,\n",
    "        * If a discount is applied, the system must enforce the rule that the total price cannot be negative, ensuring that the database remains in a valid state.\n",
    "        * A bank account can't go below zero if your account type doesn't allow overdrafts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I - Isolation**:\n",
    "    * Isolation ensures that multiple transactions do not interfere with each other.\n",
    "    * Even if two customers try to book the same seat, one transaction will complete first, locking the seat, while the other transaction will fail or be retried, preventing double booking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **D - Durability**:\n",
    "    * Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently stored in the database.\n",
    "    * Even if the system crashes or there is a power failure, the committed data will not be lost. This is typically achieved using logs, backups, and stable storage mechanisms.\n",
    "    * For example, if you successfully book a flight ticket and the system crashes right after, your booking should still be saved when the system restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need ACID?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Importance:\n",
    "* **Critical Systems**: Medical records, banking transactions, and flight bookings can't afford data inconsistencies\n",
    "* **Multiple Users**: Modern applications serve thousands of users simultaneously - their actions must not conflict\n",
    "* **System Failures**: Power outages, network issues, or hardware failures shouldn't corrupt or lose our data"
